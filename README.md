### 🚀 *Day X — Firebase Login & Signup App Completed!*  

Hey everyone 👋  

Today I finished building my **Android Login–Signup App** using **Java**, **XML**, and **Firebase Realtime Database**.  

💡 **Here’s what I built:**
- Splash screen with app logo  
- User Signup with Firebase integration  
- Secure Login with password validation  
- Profile page that displays user details  
- Simple & elegant lavender + grey UI  

🧩 **Tech Stack:**  
Java | XML | Firebase | Android Studio  

This project helped me strengthen my concepts in:
- Firebase Realtime Database CRUD operations  
- Android Intent navigation  
- UI design and XML layouts  

💬 Would love your feedback and suggestions for new features!

Would you like me to add your **GitHub repo link** and format the post with emojis & bullet icons (like a professional showcase post)?
